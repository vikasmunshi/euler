Project Euler Problem 74: Digit Factorial Chains.

Problem Statement:
    The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits
    is equal to 145:
        1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

    Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link
    back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:
        169 -> 363601 -> 1454 -> 169
        871 -> 45361 -> 871
        872 -> 45362 -> 872

    It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop.
    For example:
        69 -> 363600 -> 1454 -> 169 -> 363601 (-> 1454)
        78 -> 45360 -> 871 -> 45361 (-> 871)
        540 -> 145 (-> 145)

    Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating
    chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.

    How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?

Solution Approach:
    Use memoization to store chain lengths for numbers to avoid recomputation.
    Precompute factorials of digits 0-9 for fast lookup.
    For each starting number below one million, generate the digit factorial sum chain until
    a loop or repetition is detected.
    Count chains with exactly 60 non-repeating terms.
    The solution involves efficient simulation and caching for performance (O(n) expected).
    Number theory and combinatorics help to identify repeated loops and avoid redundant calculations.
