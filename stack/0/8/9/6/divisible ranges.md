divisible ranges

A contiguous range of positive integers is called a divisible range if all the integers in the range can be arranged in a row such that the $n$-th term is a multiple of $n$.
For example, the range $[6..9]$ is a divisible range because we can arrange the numbers as $7,6,9,8$.
In fact, it is the $4$th divisible range of length $4$, the first three being $[1..4], [2..5], [3..6]$.

Find the $36$th divisible range of length $36$.
Give as answer the smallest number in the range.
