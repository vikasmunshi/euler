the quaternion group i

Starting from an empty string, we want to build a string with letters "x", "y", "z". At each step, one of the following operations is performed:

insert two consecutive identical letters "xx", "yy" or "zz" anywhere into the string;
replace one letter in the string with two consecutive letters, according to the rule: "x" $\to$ "yz", "y" $\to$ "zx", "z" $\to$ "xy";
exchange two consecutive different letters in the string, e.g. "xy" $\to$ "yx", "zx" $\to$ "xz", etc.

A string is called neutral if it is possible to produce the string from the empty string after an even number of steps.

We define a sequence $(a_n)_{n \ge 0}$: $a_0=88\,888\,888$ and $a_n=(8888\cdot a_{n-1})\bmod 888\,888\,883$ for $n \gt 0$.

Let $b_n = a_n \bmod 3$. For each $i \ge 0$, a string $c(i)$ of length $50$ is defined by translating the finite sequence $b_{50i},b_{50i+1},\dots,b_{50i+49}$ via the rule: $0 \to$ "x", $1 \to$ "y", $2 \to$ "z".

Let $F(N)$ be the number of ordered pairs $(i, j)$ with $0 \le i, j \lt N$ such that the concatenated string $c(i)c(j)$ is neutral.
For example, $F(10) = 13$ and $F(100) = 1224$.

Find $F(10^6)$.
