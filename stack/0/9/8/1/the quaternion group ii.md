the quaternion group ii

Starting from an empty string, we want to build a string with letters "x", "y", "z". At each step, one of the following operations is performed:

insert two consecutive identical letters "xx", "yy" or "zz" anywhere into the string;
replace one letter in the string with two consecutive letters, according to the rule: "x" $\to$ "yz", "y" $\to$ "zx", "z" $\to$ "xy";
exchange two consecutive different letters in the string, e.g. "xy" $\to$ "yx", "zx" $\to$ "xz", etc.

A string is called neutral if it is possible to produce the string from the empty string after an even number of steps.

Let $N(X, Y, Z)$ be the number of neutral strings which contain $X$ copies of "x", $Y$ copies of "y" and $Z$ copies of "z".
For example, $N(2, 2, 2) = 42$ and $N(8, 8, 8) = 4732773210$.

Find the sum of $N(i^3, j^3, k^3)$ for $0 \le i, j, k \lt 88$. Give your answer modulo $888\,888\,883$.
