partisan nim

Two players A and B are playing a variant of Nim.
At the beginning, there are several piles of stones. Each pile is either at the side of A or at the side of B. The piles are unordered.

They make moves in turn. At a player's turn, the player can

either choose a pile on the opponent's side and remove one stone from that pile;
or choose a pile on their own side and remove the whole pile.
The winner is the player who removes the last stone.

Let $E(N)$ be the number of initial settings with at most $N$ stones such that, whoever plays first, A always has a winning strategy.

For example $E(4) = 9$; the settings are:

Nr.
Piles at the side of A
Piles at the side of B
1
$4$
none
2
$1, 3$
none
3
$2, 2$
none
4
$1, 1, 2$

6

Find $E(5000) \bmod 1234567891$.
