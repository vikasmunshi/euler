**Mathematics and computing are not separate disciplines - they are two lenses on the same underlying structure.**
Project Euler sits at that intersection: problems that look like puzzles but reward the kind of thinking that
distinguishes an engineer from a programmer. The right algorithm does not just run faster; it reveals why brute
force was never the right question.

This repository is a record of that journey. Where multiple approaches were tried, all are sometimes kept:
the naïve solution alongside the elegant one, because the contrast is the lesson.

The framework around the solutions is deliberate. Problems are fetched, solutions are scaffolded and
benchmarked, and later problems are encrypted – all from a single interactive/web shell. An incorporated AI agent enables
reflection and learning: explore alternatives after solving a problem, translate Python to C for a performance
comparison, or articulate the mathematical insight in plain language.
**The point never is to get an answer but to understand why it is the answer.**

*In accordance with [Project Euler's guidelines](https://projecteuler.net/about#publish), solutions and notes after the
first 100 problems are encrypted; for collaboration on those, please follow the instructions in
the [Key Exchange](docs/user-guide.md#7-key-exchange) section of the User Guide.*

### Documentation

The framework is documented in four guides under [`docs/`](docs/), plus the
authoritative command-language spec:

| Guide                                      | For                     | Covers                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)           | using the shell         | launching, command blocks, variables, loops, the command catalogue, key exchange |
| [Solver Guide](docs/solver-guide.md)       | solving problems        | the `@runner.main` decorator, test cases, the solve workflow                     |
| [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md) | extending the framework | the `@register` contract, command modules, the module loader                     |
| [Command Index](docs/commands-index.md)    | reference               | every command's aliases, flags, and exact usage                                  |
| [Language reference](docs/syntax.md)       | the command language    | surface syntax, canonical form, semantics                                        |

The command catalogue and command index are regenerated from the live registry by the
`update-docs` shell command - `solver "update-docs"` after changing any command's name,
alias, help, or usage (`solver "update-docs --check"` fails if they are stale).

This README covers everything *outside* those guides: installation, dependencies, and the
design notes.

### Installation

> **Prefer not to install?** A live instance of the web front end runs at
> **[euler.vikasmunshi.com](https://euler.vikasmunshi.com)** — the same `solver` shell,
> read-only viewer, and editor in the browser, served over HTTPS. Access is gated by a
> login (see [Authentication](docs/authentication.md)); if you'd like an account to explore
> or collaborate, [reach out](mailto:vikas.munshi@gmail.com). To run your own copy, install below.

Clone the repository and install system dependencies via [make](Makefile) or the bash [scripts](scripts);
the framework itself is installed with `pip`. Solutions can be written in any language – anything that runs as a
script or compiles to a binary will work.
The setup scripts and Makefile use `apt` and are tailored for Debian-based systems (Ubuntu). They are also
configured for Python and C, which is what I primarily use – feel free to adapt them for your own
OS, languages, and toolchains.

<summary>one-line install (curl)</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vikasmunshi/euler/master/install.sh | bash
```

By default this clones to `~/euler` and runs `make install-all`. To choose a different path:

```bash

Launch the web-based solver shell with `solver-web` or launch the interactive terminal with `solver` (or
`python -m solver`); Type `?` for the command list, `? <cmd>` for usage, and `exit` / Ctrl-D to quit. `solver` can also
be driven non-interactively by passing a quoted command block (`solver "eval 42; benchmark 42"`), exiting with the
block's status. The full workflow - `new`, `eval`, `benchmark`, `mark` - is in
the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) and [Solver Guide](docs/solver-guide.md);
the [Command Index](docs/commands-index.md) lists every command.

A note on the AI assistance: two complementary paths are wired into the shell, both
aimed at deepening understanding rather than skipping it - the single-shot
**`claude-api`** (generate a solution, notes, or test cases) and the agentic
**`claude-skill`** / `! claude` (Claude Code working directly on a problem's solution files). Both need
the `ai` dependency group and an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; see the
[User Guide](docs/user-guide.md#5-ai-assistance) for the trade-offs.

### For the nerds

- **Interactive shell** - `prompt-toolkit`-based REPL with persistent history, auto-suggest, tab
  completion (including bash-native completion for `!`-prefixed commands), `{name}` variables and
  side-effect-free expressions (comparisons, arithmetic, indexing/slicing, safe builtins), and a
  `loop <list>: <block>` construct over sliceable problem lists (`{problems}`, `{solved}`,
  `{unsolved}`). The command language - surface syntax, canonical form, and semantics - is specified in
  [`docs/syntax.md`](docs/syntax.md).
- **Rich UI** - `rich` panels, tables, and a themed colour palette throughout, so the terminal output is as
  readable as a rendered page.
- **Web front end** - `solver-web` runs a single localhost `aiohttp` server (port 8080) with three concerns
  in one place: a browser **terminal** (xterm.js over a PTY running a real `solver` shell), a read-only
  **viewer** that assembles each problem's page - statement, notes, and benchmark results - on the fly, and an
  in-browser **editor** that saves, evaluates, and deletes a problem's solution files. It runs detached
  (survives the launching shell); `solver-web start|stop|status|restart` manages it, and `show N` auto-starts
  it to open a problem (or the index) in the browser.
- **Hosted over HTTPS** - the web front end is served publicly at
  [euler.vikasmunshi.com](https://euler.vikasmunshi.com). **Caddy** terminates TLS and reverse-proxies to the
  loopback aiohttp server, loading a Let's Encrypt certificate that **acme.sh** issues and auto-renews through a
  name.com **DNS-01** challenge (no inbound port 80). Access is gated in the app - not Caddy - by browser-side
  **SRP-6a** login (the password never crosses the wire), with per-identity **profiles** (admin / user / guest)
  deciding which commands and routes each caller may use. Setup scripts (`scripts/setup/caddy.sh`,
  `scripts/setup/acme.sh`) install Caddy and issue the cert; the full stack is documented in three guides:
  [TLS](docs/tls-guide.md), [authentication](docs/authentication.md), and [authorization](docs/authorization.md).
- **Problem scraping** - fetches and caches problem statements directly from projecteuler.net; no manual copy-paste.
- **Solution evaluation** - subprocess-based test harness with configurable timeouts, result recording, and support for
  any language that compiles or runs as a script.
- **Transparent encryption** - solutions for #101+ are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM; each file-encryption key is
  itself wrapped by a per-user master key, delivered via X25519 ECDH + HKDF-SHA256 + ChaCha20-Poly1305, with
  n-of-m secret sharing for master-key recovery.
- **AI Agents** - two paths to an agentic assistant:
    - the single-shot Claude **API** (`claude-api py|c|notes|test-cases`) for solutions and documentation,
    - and full **Claude Code** driven from the shell both interactively (`! claude`)
      and headless (`claude-skill <action>`, via the `claude-euler-solver` skill);
    - API token costs per `solver` session are tracked, use the command `costs` to show.
- **Performance dashboard** - benchmarks solutions and records execution times, building a personal history of the
  journey through the problems.

<!-- /GEN:package-layout -->

Every shell command is a plain Python function decorated with `@register(...)`
(defined in `solver/shell/register.py`, re-exported from `solver.shell`). The decorator handles
`shlex` tokenisation, type coercion (`Literal` / `bool` / `int` / `Optional`), and tab-completion;
commands are collected at import time, and `solver/modules.csv` lists the modules loaded
on startup. Framework built-ins (`echo`, `clear`, `?`, `!`) are registered the same way
from `shell/builtins.py` and `shell/bash.py`. The full contract is documented in
the [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md).

Every command returns an `int` exit code (`0` = success), so the shell composes them into command
blocks - `;` (sequential), `&&` (on success), `||` (on failure), and `{ … }` groups - through the
`lexer → parser → interpreter` pipeline. `loop`, `break` / `continue` / `exit`, `{name}` variables, and
side-effect-free expressions are language constructs (not commands); `solver <cmd>` exits with the
block's status. The language is specified end-to-end in
[`docs/syntax.md`](docs/syntax.md).
