# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Python Environment

The project requires Python 3.14+, provided by the project virtualenv (`.venv`), which is on
`PATH` in this environment. Use the **bare** commands — `python`, `solver`, `mypy`, `flake8` —
not the `.venv/bin/...` paths: the permission allowlist in `.claude/settings.local.json` grants
`python:*`, `solver *`, `mypy *`, and `flake8 *`, so the bare forms run without a confirmation
prompt while `.venv/bin/python` would not match.

```bash
python -m solver        # run the interactive shell
solver                  # same, via entry point
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install (full developer setup)
make install-all

# Lint and type-check
scripts/linters/check.sh solver   # runs mypy + flake8 on the solver package

# Individually
mypy solver
flake8 solver                     # max-line-length 120

# Run the shell interactively
make run

# Full-tree audit (~25s): solutions/private encrypted at rest, no compiled binaries tracked.
# The git hooks run the same checks scoped to what you stage/push; this sweeps settled history.
make audit                        # also: the `git-audit` shell command

# Run shell commands non-interactively (a command block; exits with its status)
solver "eval 42; benchmark 42"

# Deploy the web front end (systemd services behind a TLS edge — needs sudo).
# There is no local server: see docs/web-server-guide.md.
make deploy-web         # also: remove-web | redeploy-web | upgrade-web
```

Make target verbs follow the two kinds of target, and always match the action the
underlying script in `scripts/setup/` takes:

- **local** (what the terminal solver needs — apt packages, `.venv`, hooks, completions,
  Chrome, Claude Code, Node.js): `install` / `uninstall`.
- **system** (what the solver web needs — root's systemd, the `euler-*` identities,
  `/etc/euler`, `/opt/euler`): `deploy` / `remove` / `redeploy`, plus `upgrade` on the
  kits where it differs from `deploy` (see docs/web-server-guide.md § 14.2).

## Git Hooks

The hooks are rendered from the templates in `scripts/setup/hooks/` (`pre-commit.template`, `pre-push.template`) into the **default** location `.git/hooks/` by `scripts/setup/githooks.sh install`. This runs via `make install-hooks` (and is part of `make install-all`), which also resets `core.hooksPath` to the default; `make uninstall-hooks` removes them. Edit the templates, not the installed copies, then re-run the installer.

Pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) auto-fixes trailing whitespace in staged text files (and checks for leftover whitespace / conflict markers), then runs `flake8` and `mypy` on the `solutions` and `solver` directories. All checks must pass for the commit to proceed.

Pre-push hook (`.git/hooks/pre-push`) runs additional checks before pushing to remote.

To test the pre-push hook without actually pushing:
```bash
echo "refs/heads/master $(git rev-parse HEAD) refs/heads/master $(git rev-parse origin/master)" | bash .git/hooks/pre-push
```

## Documentation

User- and developer-facing docs live under `docs/`:

- `docs/user-guide.md` — using the shell: invocation, command blocks, variables, loops, command catalogue.
- `docs/solver-guide.md` — solving problems: the `@runner.main` decorator, test cases, the solve workflow.
- `docs/developer-guide.md` — extending the framework: the `@register` contract, command modules, the loader.
- `docs/commands-index.md` — every command's aliases, flags, and exact usage.
- `docs/syntax.md` — the authoritative command-language reference.

The command catalogue (in `user-guide.md`) and `commands-index.md` are **generated** from the live
registry by the `update-docs` command (`solver/utils/update_doc.py`). After changing any command's
name, alias, `help_text`, or signature, run `update-docs` (`solver "update-docs --check"` verifies
they are current).

### Command registration

Every shell command is a plain Python function decorated with `@register(help_text=..., aliases=..., pass_ctx=..., quietable=...)` from `solver.shell`. The command name is derived from the function name (underscores → dashes; `usage` is synthesised from the signature). The decorator handles argument tokenisation (`shlex.split`), type coercion (Literal, bool, int, Optional, Enum), and tab-completion. Commands are collected at import time; `solver/modules.csv` (read by `utils/loader.py`) lists which modules to import on startup.

Functions still work as normal Python — they are not transformed, just registered. See `docs/developer-guide.md` for the full register contract.

### Command contract & blocks

Every command returns an `int` Unix exit code (`0` = success, non-zero = failure); the `@register`
adapter forwards it verbatim. Input runs through a `lexer → parser → interpreter` pipeline
(authoritative spec: `docs/syntax.md`): commands compose with `;` (sequential), `&&` (on
success), `||` (on failure) and `{ … }` groups, nesting arbitrarily, with a newline as an implied `;`.
A statement is a command, a `name = expr` assignment, or a bare expression (`rcode` 0 when truthy, 1
when falsy) — so expressions gate `&&`/`||` chains. `loop <list>: <block>` is a language construct that
runs its `{ … }` (or inline) body once per element of a list, binding the current element to `{loop}`;
`break`/`continue`/`exit` are flow words. The lexer normalises input to a canonical guarded form (§8 of
docs/syntax.md). `solver <cmd>` exits with the block's status, so steps can be gated directly
(`solver "eval 42 && benchmark 42"`).

### Stack (solutions storage)

Solutions live under `solutions/`, one directory per problem: plaintext problems in `solutions/public/pNNNN/` (e.g. problem 42 → `solutions/public/p0042/`) and encrypted problems in `solutions/private/pXXXX_YYYY/pNNNN/`, bucketed by century (e.g. problem 101 → `solutions/private/p0100_0199/p0101/`).

- `solutions/public/`: all files stored in plain text.
- `solutions/private/`: solution code, test cases, results, and notes are encrypted at rest (AES-256) by a transparent git clean/smudge filter (`crypto/gitfilter.py`) — ciphertext in git, plaintext in the working tree once the master key is available.

Commands operate directly on each problem's files (resolved via `problem.solution_dir`); the git filter handles encryption on commit / decryption on checkout.

### Encryption key hierarchy

The crypto sub-package is three modules: `ciphers.py` (non-interactive: `config_dict` with all file
locations + git-filter wire constants — **no `solver.config` dependency** — plus load/lock/unlock and
encrypt/decrypt helpers), `keys.py` (all interactive create/persist/rotate/share and
the shell commands), and `gitfilter.py` (the git clean/smudge filter, depending only on `ciphers`).

- Per-user private key: `~/.euler/id` (X25519, PKCS8 PEM, **plain/unencrypted**). It lives in a
  machine-local `0600` secrets dir — a sibling dot-directory named for the repo (`~/euler` →
  `~/.euler`), **outside** the checkout — so file permissions are its protection and the load path
  needs no password.
- `keys/enc-key.json`: a single 32-byte master key, identified-by-public-key — `{<public-key-hex>:
  <master key wrapped to that key>}` plus a `verify` ciphertext for self-checking. One entry per
  authorised public key; no email is stored. Authority is proof-of-possession. (Stays in-repo:
  wrapped master keys are useless without a private key.)
- Decryption path: load private key → unwrap master key → verify → decrypt files.

### Solution file naming

`p<NNNN>_s<K>.<ext>` — problem number zero-padded to 4 digits, solution index starting at 0, extension `py` or `c`. Multiple solutions per problem are supported.

### Solution script interface

The runner framework (`solver/runners/`) supplies the harness; a solution only implements `solve()`:
- Python: decorate `solve(*args: str) -> str` with `@runner.main` (`from solver.runners import runner`).
  C: write `const char *solve(int argc, char *argv[])` and `#include "runner.h"`.
- The runner — `@runner.main` / `runner.h`'s `main()` — passes the test-case `input` values as
  positional args in order, parses `--runs=N` and `--show`, runs the timed loop, checks the result
  is consistent across runs, and prints the single stdout line `<runs> <avg_seconds> <result>`.
- `solve()` only *returns* the answer as a string; it must never print that final line itself, and
  exits non-zero on error.
- Argument/resource helpers live on the runner: `parse_int`, `parse_list`, `get_text_file`, and the
  `show` flag (Python `runner.show`, C `show`) gating `--show` diagnostics.

See `solver/templates/new.py` / `new.c` for the canonical templates.

### AI features

Two AI entry points, both calling the Claude API. Install the optional deps with `pip install -e ".[ai]"` (`anthropic` + `python-dotenv`); the key is `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, read from the project env file `~/.euler/env` (`config.env_file`, `models.py:get_api_key`).

- **`claude-api`** (`solver/ai/api.py`) generates solution artifacts, dispatching to per-target generators — `code.py` (Python/C), `docs.py` (notes), `facts.py` (test cases) — with prompts in `solver/templates/prompt_*.txt`. Default models: Opus for code (Python + C) and notes, Sonnet for test cases. The `costs` command (`models.py`) reports accumulated token spend.
- **`euler-solve`** (`solver/ai/skill.py`) launches Claude Code headless against a problem's solution files, via the `claude-euler-solver` skill (`solver/ai/claude/skills/claude-euler-solver/`). Invoked as `claude -p /claude-euler-solver <problem_number> <action>`, running at the repo root; its actions are `solve` and `review`. The skill's standards live in the `docs/convention_*.md` guides (also injected into the `claude-api` prompts via `templates/engine.py`).

### Web front end

There is **no local server and no `solver-web` script**. The front end is a deployed stack of isolated systemd services behind a Caddy TLS edge, each on its own unix socket under `/run/euler/`, run from the root-owned `/opt/euler` venv. The design of record is **`docs/web-server-guide.md`** — read it before changing anything under `solver/web/`.

The shape in one paragraph: Caddy terminates TLS, strips client identity headers, authenticates every request through the auth service's `forward_auth`, and routes by the returned `X-User-Slug` to **one service per collaborator** (`euler-user@<slug>`, `User=euler-user-<slug>`), which serves that user's content routes **and** their `/ws` terminal from their own `~/euler` clone. Authentication is browser-side SRP-6a (`solver/web/auth`); authorization is the profile ladder (`solver/auth`). Each collaborator has their own uid, home, clone, branch, and encrypted vault (`solver/crypto/vault.py`), so their keys are exposed only to their own code.

The `show`/`edit` commands (`solver/core/viewer.py`) drive the browser over a channel-aware bridge: from a **web** shell an `OSC 5379` sequence rides the PTY → WebSocket pipe and swaps the app shell's left pane; from a **terminal** they open `config.base_url` (`$EULER_BASE_URL`) in a named browser tab (`solver-doc`). Per-user shell state — history, session log, last active problem — lives under `.state/<slug>/`, the slug resolved by `solver/auth` and wired into `config`.

## Solution Code Conventions

- Solution files for problems > 100 live under `solutions/private/` — ciphertext in git, plaintext in the working tree once the master key is available (the git clean/smudge filter decrypts on checkout). Read and edit them like any other solution. **Hard rule: the decrypted plaintext must never leave the repo.** Never paste it into an external service, artifact, web page, log, chat, or any output that escapes the local working tree; never commit or push it unencrypted (only the git filter's ciphertext may land in git); never copy it outside `solutions/private/`. When in doubt, treat the plaintext as strictly confidential and keep it in-tree.
- For code structure and patterns, any solution serves as a reference — the plaintext `solutions/public/` ones (e.g. `solutions/public/p000*/`) are the most convenient since they need no key.
- Build sieves, precomputed tables, and caches (`@cache`/`@lru_cache`, memo dicts) **inside** `solve()` (or in helpers it calls fresh each call), sized to the inputs — **not** at module level with a fixed bound. With `--runs=N` the harness times the repeated `solve()` calls, so anything built once at import (or a cache kept warm between runs) is excluded from the first run and free thereafter, understating the real cost. See `solutions/public/p0007/p0007_s0.py` (sieve sized to `n·ln n`) and `solutions/public/p0035/p0035_s0.py`.
